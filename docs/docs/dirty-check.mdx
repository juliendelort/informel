# Dirty Check

A form is "dirty" if any of its field has changed since:

-   it was loaded
-   or it was last reset
-   or it was last submitted

When the form is dirty:

-   `<inform-el/>` has a `dirty` attribute: `<inform-el dirty />`.
-   `<inform-el/>` has a `dirty` property:

```js
document.querySelector("inform-el").dirty; // true
```

The example below uses the dirty attribute and CSS to show a warning only when the form is dirty:

<iframe width="100%" height="600" src="//jsfiddle.net/juliendelort/exm47c1b/5/embedded/result,html/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allowpaymentrequest frameborder="0"></iframe>

Try changing the first name: the warning appears.
Try setting the first name back to "changeme": the warning disappears!
