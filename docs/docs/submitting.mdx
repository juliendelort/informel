# Submitting

`informel` relies on the `<form />` being submitted. This happens when:

-   Clicking on the submit button (`<button type="submit"></button>` or `<input type="submit" />`).
-   Calling [form.requestSubmit()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/requestSubmit)

:::danger form.submit()
Calling [form.submit()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/submit) would also submit the form, but it would bypass all the checks performed by `informel`.
:::

The submission stops if some fields are in error.

All fields become "touched" when attempting to submit the form and errors are displayed.

## `submit` event

When the form is valid and the form is submitted, the `submit` event is triggered and the form values are passed in the [event detail field](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent/detail)

```js
document.querySelector("inform-el").addEventListener("submit", ({ detail: { values } }) => {
    console.log("Successfully submitted!", values);
});
```

## Sending AJAX request on submit

If the [action](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#attr-action) and [method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#attr-method) attributes are specified
on the form, `informel` will automatically send the corresponding AJAX request on submit.

:::danger `action` and `method` are `<form/>` attributes, not `<inform-el />` attributes!
:::

See the example below:

<JokesExample />

Different events are emitted along the way:

-   `request-start`: The AJAX request has started. `detail` contains the following fields:
    -   `values`: the form values.
-   `request-success`: The AJAX request has succeeded (status 2XX). `detail` contains the following fields:
    -   `values`: the form values.
    -   `response`: the json response.
    -   `status`: the http status.
-   `request-error`: The AJAX request has returned an error (status != 2XX) or there was an exception. `detail` contains the following fields:
    -   `values`: the form values.
    -   `response`: the json response.
    -   `status`: the http status
    -   `error`: if there was an exception, the error.
-   `request-end`: The AJAX request has end, regardless of the result. `detail` contains the following fields:
    -   `values`: the form values.

## Sending files

If any of the field is of type [File](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File/File), the is sent with header [Content-Type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type) `multipart/form-data`.
Otherwise, the data is sent with header [Content-Type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type) `application/json`.

## Transforming form values before submitting

`<inform-el>` has a `submitTransform()` method called before submission, if implemented.

It receives the form values as parameter and must returns the parameters to send, as an object.

Example:

```js
document.querySelector("inform-el").submitTransform = (values) => ({
    ...values,
    fullName: values.firstName + " " + values.lastName,
});
```

## Restting the form after submission

It is possible to automatically reset the form after submission by using the `reset-on-submit` attribute:

```html
<inform-el reset-on-submit> ... </inform-el>
```

## submit-on-change

`<inform-field />` supports `submit-on-change` field which will trigger form submission whenever the field has
changed (received the [change event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/change_event)).

For example:

```html
<inform-el>
    <form action={`https://todo.test/api/task/${task.id}`} method="post">
        <inform-field submit-on-change>
            <input type="checkbox" name="done" />
        </inform-field>
    </form>
</inform-el>
```

The above sents a POST request to `https://todo.test/api/task/${task.id}` with body params `{done: true|false}` when
the checkbox is toggled.
